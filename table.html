<td><h4><b>Rome</b></h4>When you visit the Eternal City, prepare to cross a few must-see attractions – including the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon – off of your bucket list. Additional treasures, such as St. Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, can be found in nearby Vatican City. Escape the tourist crowds by taking a twilight stroll along the cobblestone streets of Trastevere, or head to Mercato Centrale Roma to sample local delicacies like gelato and pizza.</td>

    <td><h4><b>Maldives</b></h4>It is not cheap or easy to reach, but this isolated paradise between the Arabian and Laccadive seas is the personification of a dreamy tropical vacation. In this South Asian destination, which is made up of more than 1,000 islands, thatched-roof bungalows sit above crystal-clear aquamarine waters, providing easy water access and a romantic atmosphere. </td>

For stunning scenery, check out the limestone cliffs of Phang Nga Bay and lounge on Phuket's gorgeous white sand beaches (Freedom Beach and Bangtao Beach are two visitor favorites).</td>

     <td><h4><b>New zealand</b></h4> New Zealand's South Island brims with majestic landscapes at every turn, from dramatic mountains to fjords to glaciers. Here, you can admire the mountains of Fiordland National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, from hiking trails or a boat on Milford Sound. At night, journey to the University of Canterbury's Mount John Observatory to gaze at the starry skies. </td>
